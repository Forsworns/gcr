## Welcome to GRC site.

欢迎来到GRC的小网站, 我是@sdttttt, 其实开发GRC的初衷很简单, 只是想把`git-cz`从`node.js`的环境拿出来. 加上一些我认为更棒的功能.
GRC是由Rust编写的, 别担心, 我是一位Rust的新手, GRC的源代码也并不复杂. 除去单元测试, 有效代码实际上只有几百行.

在编写GRC的时期, 我每天都和`rustc`吵架, 不过在最后的我们双方都妥协了. 
GRC终于是诞生了. 我在构思程序的结构上花了很多时间.

如果你喜欢GRC,欢迎你提出新的意见, 当然, 如果你能贡献PR我会非常高兴.

Welcome to the GRC site. I'm @sdttttt. The original purpose of GRC development was simple: to take `git-cz` out of the NodeJS environment. Add some features that I think are even better.

GRC is written by Rust. Don't worry, I am new to Rust, and GRC source code is not complicated. Apart from the unit tests, there are actually only a few hundred lines of valid code.



During the writing of GRC, I quarreled with 'RUstc' every day, but in the end we both gave in.
GRC was finally born. I spent a lot of time thinking about the structure of the program.

If you like GRC, you are welcome to make new Suggestions. Of course, I would be very happy if you could contribute PR.
